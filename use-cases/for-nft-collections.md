# ðŸŽ¨ For NFT Collections

ShareMint works great for NFT creators.

Incentivise your community to invite friends to you project by providing a referral link to each member.

It also aligns you properly with external partners you work with by offering them a revenue share from the revenue they generate for the project.

Affiliates can refer directly to the mint page or in the allowlist phase. ShareMint natively supports allowlists and also provides an integration for HeyMint allowlists.

NFT collections that launched a program on ShareMint achieved great results. You can learn more about them [here](https://blog.sharemint.xyz/nft-case-studies).
