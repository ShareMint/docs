# ðŸ—¼ Tiered Rewards

The tiered rewards feature is designed to encourage users to engage with your program at a deeper level by providing increasing benefits for higher levels of engagement.

### Overview

Tiered rewards is a system where your users can earn more rewards as they refer more people. The structure is set up so that greater rewards are earned at higher "tiers" of referrals. For example, a user may earn 5 USDC for the first referral, but earn 20 USDC for three referrals, and so on. This system creates a compelling incentive for users to refer as many people as they can.

Here's an example:

* **1 invite**: Reward 5 USDC
* **3 invites**: Reward 20 USDC
* **10 invites**: Reward 100 USDC

### Setting Up Tiered Rewards

To set up a tiered rewards program, follow these steps:

1. **Visit your Project settings**
2. **Select the 'Tiered' option in the Affiliates section**
3. **Add a Tier by clicking "Add Reward"**: set the reward to the value you want. eg 10 USDC.
4. **Click "Advanced referee requirements" and set referrals required to unlock**: you can set a different number of referrals and conditions to unlock each tier.

An affiliate will unlock all earn the rewards in each tier. Tiers are not mutually exclusive. If you have a reward for inviting 3 people, and a reward for inviting 10 people, if the affiliate invites 10 people, they will have unlocked both rewards.

### Communicating Tiered Rewards to Users

It's important to clearly communicate how your tiered rewards system works to your users. You may wish to provide details in your terms and conditions, in the referral program section of your website, and in any marketing or communication materials relating to the program.

Remember to highlight the benefits of reaching higher tiers to encourage users to make more referrals.
