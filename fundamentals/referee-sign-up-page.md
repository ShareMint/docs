# üèå Referee Sign Up Page

Once an affiliate has signed up they will receive a link to share with others.

This link can point to three different page types:

1. ShareMint page
2. Direct website integration
3. External program
4. ShareMint reward page

You set this when creating a project. You can later change this in the project _Settings_ tab.

### ShareMint page

If you select "ShareMint page" users will be sent to a ShareMint website where they will be asked to connect their wallet.

You can also ask them to complete other steps before gaining access, such as following you on Twitter, liking tweets, being part of a Discord, or inviting others to the project. This is common in allowlists for NFT mints. You can also ask for a user's email at this stage.

Once a user has completed these steps they can be directed to a new url. For example, you might ask the user to connect their wallet and immediately send them to a page to complete their purchase.

### Direct website integration

If you select this option you will need to integrate ShareMint into your website. The integration is two lines of code and should be easy for your developer to add. For more on integrating directly into your website, see the [Integrating ShareMint into your Website](integrating-sharemint-into-your-website.md) page.

### External program

Select this option in a case where you have already built an in-house referral program or your program is powered by a different product and you still wish to use ShareMint in order to reach affiliates.

You will need to add the URL of the page the explains your program and allows affiliates to register.

Users will sent to a ShareMint page providing information about your program and a redirect button.

You will be able to add the program to the ShareMint marketplace for affiliates to find and communicate with the ShareMint partners directly from your dashboard.
### ShareMint rewards page

If you select "ShareMint Rewards Page" users will be sent to a ShareMint website where they will be asked to connect their wallet.

They will see a list of tasks they can complete in order to generate rewards.

After each task is completed, the user is able to claim the rewards by a click of a button.

You can also ask them to complete other steps before gaining access, such as following you on Twitter, liking tweets, being part of a Discord, or inviting others to the project. This is common in allowlists for NFT mints. You can also ask for a user's email at this stage.

Please speak to the ShareMint team in order to use this option.
