# ðŸ“– Export as CSV

To export your data as CSV you can go to the dashboard for your project and click the Export to CSV button at the top of the users table.

This will export all your users and will also include additional information that may be helpful such as a hash of the user's IP so you can check if there are users using the same IP trying to game your referral program.
