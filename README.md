## Overview

75% of brands use affiliate or referral marketing to increase sales.

Referral marketing is the most-effective form of marketing. People are four times more likely to buy when referred by a friend.

A strong referral and affiliate program is key to incentivising others to share your project. 83% of consumers are willing to refer after a positive experienceâ€”yet only 29% actually do.

Each marketing channel you use becomes that much more effective. Each new community member becomes a potential marketer for your project. By not offering a referral program you are leaving money on the table.

An affiliate program incentivises media publishers to share your projects. Whether it's a blog author, YouTuber, Twitter influencer, or news websites. By offering a referral program you make it easy for them to cover your project. Amazon Associates is the world's largest affiliate program with over 900,000 active affiliates and the web is scattered with links to Amazon because of it.

Affiliate marketing is a cost-effecitve low-risk way to market your product. Affiliates are rewarded for the value they provide. It's a win-win for both parties. The affiliate drives revenue for the project, and by doing so, generates revenue for itself.

Traditional affiliate marketing platforms are not optimized for web3. They don't track crypto purchases or provide on-chain analytics to optimise your marketing efforts. ShareMint provides a web3 native affiliate marketing platform designed for web3 businesses.
